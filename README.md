# fishpy

fishpy is a clone of the old Flash game "fishy", where you control a fish trying
to survive in a dangerous pond. You eat everything smaller than you are, and you
avoid anything bigger.

## Installation

Fishpy runs under Python 3. There is no installer.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/gfetterman/fishpy.git
```

Fishpy requires pygame to run.

```shell
$ pip install pygame
```

(You could use a conda environment if you like.)

To play:

```shell
$ python fishpy.py
```

## Notes

Fishy clones abound on the internet. This one isn't anything special, but I
wanted something to build to start fiddling with pygame, so here you are.

It's a good deal shorter than the original, mostly so I could test all of the
parts without having to play for ten minutes.

I made the little fish icons myself. I think they're cute. You may disagree.
